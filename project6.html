    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <h2>A place that I would like to visit</h2>
    <p>I would like to go to China or Japan. I chose these two because I want to see the great wall and the mountains in Japan and visit tokyo</P>
    <h2>A person I admire <br />(past or present) 
      </h2>
    <p>I admire Sean or as many people call him Jacksepticeye. He is a funny youtuber that does video games for his job. 
      He is for a little bit a of a more mature audience but is very funny. He is up beat and happy in all of his videos and it makes you
      happy. His Irish accent is also fun to listen to.</p>
